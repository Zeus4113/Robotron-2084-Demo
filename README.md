# Robotron-2084-Demo
 A remake of Williams Electronics Robotron 2084, built using C++ and SFML.

I developed this demo over the course of 8 weeks (around 80 hours) without using a game engine. This helped develop my knowledge of low-level gameplay implementations within C++, as well as give me an increased understanding of how commercial game engines function.
